# OSSN-ImagesInMessage
An improvement on OssnMessages component to allow the user to attach images. Images also appear properly into OssnChat component, but isn't possible (yet) to send images through this component.

If [FancyBox component](https://www.opensource-socialnetwork.org/component/view/369/fancybox) is enabled, images can be open in fullscreen mode.

## Changes

- Version 1.1
    - Fix cache issue #2. Tested in both scenarios (cache on and off)
    - Fixed issue #1, after suggestion of @lianglee. However images sent using version 1.0 of component wont appear anymore. It's necessarily an issue to fix?
- Version 1.0
    - First release, with few tests. Use in production by your own risk.
